# Advanced Hand Gesture Recognition System

A sophisticated hand gesture recognition system using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Custom hand detection using OpenCV
- Advanced gesture recognition with deep learning
- Real-time visualization of hand landmarks
- Support for multiple gestures including:
  - Wave
  - Thumbs up/down
  - Peace sign
  - Open/closed palm
  - Point
  
## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the main program:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Main application entry point
- `hand_detector.py`: Custom hand detection implementation
- `gesture_recognizer.py`: Gesture classification model
- `utils.py`: Helper functions and utilities
- `visualization.py`: Real-time visualization tools

## Implementation Details
This project implements hand gesture recognition using computer vision techniques and deep learning. Unlike other implementations that rely solely on pre-built solutions, this project:
- Uses custom hand detection algorithms
- Implements unique feature extraction methods
- Provides real-time visualization of hand tracking
- Includes a custom-trained gesture recognition model
